#This is a quick and dirty program to give sample tests based on Dr. Smith's practice question pools. 
#A command line flag specifies the quiz number
#if the quiz hasn't already been downloaded it will be, and then it will be parsed into two lists
#The question list contains each question and multiple choice answers, and an answer list which has...the answers
#A second flag lets the user choose between a short or full quiz, defaulting to short. 
#Once the quiz is finished, any questions that were answered incorrectly will be saved to a file named out for additional study
